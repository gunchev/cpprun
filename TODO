Use one of the following:

 - the stdin compilation trick:
    cat test.cpp | g++ -x c++ -

 - the shebang "hack" (no shebang, directly sh commands) to make the first line real comment.

 - (best) Compile somethign from PWD, just make sure we don't overwrite anything else.

 - and of course, we can symlink everyting from the main source's directory to the temp...


Write it in C and/or C++.
